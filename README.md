# Pi Calculator


This project aims to explore the challenge of approximating pi numerically. Currently, our app explores the use of the arctan(x) Taylor series to approximate pi and compares the performance to Machin's algorithm. We plan on adding more algorithms for further comparison. This project is the start of a collective website hosting projects that Valentin and Karthik do together.
